# A GitHub Action for Custom Jekyll Builds on GitHub Pages

A GitHub Action for building and deploying a Jekyll repo back to its `gh-pages` branch. 

**Why not just let GitHub Pages build it? Because this way we can use our own custom Jekyll plugins and build scripts.**

## Secrets
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Access key scoped to the repository, we need this to push the site files back to the repo. (specify in workflow)
  
## Environment Variables
* `GITHUB_ACTOR`: Username of repo owner or object intiating the action (GitHub Provides)
* `GITHUB_REPO`: Owner/Repository (GitHub Provides)

## Example

```yml
name: Jekyll Deploy

on: [push]

jobs: 
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Build & Deploy to GitHub Pages
        env: 
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GITHUB_REPOSITORY: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_REPOSITORY }}
          GITHUB_ACTOR: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACTOR }}
        uses: BryanSchuetz/jekyll-deploy-gh-pages@master
```

Clones the repo, builds the site, and commits it back to the gh-pages branch of the repository. That's it. Just add the above example to a `main.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository—see caveats below. 

## Caveats

* This uses the v2 of the Actions beta—note the Yaml based workflow syntax—you must have access to the beta release of actions.
* **`GITHUB_TOKEN`, privileges are still being sorted out by the Actions/GH-Pages team. Changes pushed to your GH-pages branch will only be picked up by the Github Pages server if your workflow is in a private repository.**
* Needs a .gemfile
* `destination:` should be set to `./build` in your _config.yml file—as God demands.
* Be sure that any custom gems needed are included in your Gemfile.
